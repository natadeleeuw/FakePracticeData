# Wrap Up Questions

1. I chose Public Mark Domain (PD) as was suggested to me. This is because I am sharing data that is free of copywrite issues, as it is made up data.

2. MSU recommends use of disciplinary specific repositories. It recommends a few general ones, such as Dryad and Zenodo.

3. Using GitHub would help my data to be easily findeable and accessible. It also allows for the upload of interoperable data types. With all the licensing information data in GitHub is also reuseable.

4. Advantages of making data widely accessible are that others can work off of your information to advance the field of study in your discipline. Many journals also require that data be accessible so having data that is already accessible makes publication easier.

5. A disadvantage is that it could be more complex to upload data in a useable format, and could create more work. There are also issues of someone using your data without proper citation.

6. I think I would publish most of my data. It will likely be weather varaibles and snowpack varaibles, so potentially someone else studying in the area could make use of it.

7. I can't think of anything of mine, but if I were to use someone else's work (such as a snow transport code) I would not share it as my own on my own GitHub account. I also would make sure there were no copywrite issues to anything I was sharing that belonged to someone else.
